title: Rails security TL;DR
---

I recently gave a talk at the [Ruby and Rails Melbourne](http://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Melbourne/) meetup. The talk itself was a super condensed version of the Ruby on Rails security training that I give.


<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="fecd0c400a73434782348153c6bd8f44" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

20 minutes was definitely not enough time to cover everything in enough detail.
Most of my slides and material came from my training so creating the slides was relatively simple.

I really enjoyed chatting with people after my talk and learnt some really interesting ways that they were solving some of their security problems. I had some great feedback from my talk and learnt about gemnasium.com which I'm going to have to start using.

If you have any questions about the talk, definitely get in contact with me and I'll be happy to answer them :smile:
